# Preface {.unnumbered}

![](pdsDarkRed.png){width=25%}

This semester you are conducting a quantitative project using an NSF-funded curriculum, [Passion Driven Statistics](https://passiondrivenstatistics.wescreates.wesleyan.edu). This is a set of tutorials---text and video---to support your work. My goal has been to keep these tutorials as simple as possible. You may need to go beyond these tutorials to conduct your research. I am here to help. Along the way you will learn to:

- manage your data
- explore your data through graphs (or in R terms plot your data)
- test hypotheses using your data

**This is a first draft. I ask that as you use these tutorials, you will note errors and suggest improvements.**

In addition to Passion Driven Statistics, these tutorials borrow from the following:

- [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html)

- [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com)

- [The PowerMutt Project](https://www.cpp.edu/~jlkorey/POWERMUTT/index.html)

- [RLadies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/)

And a big thanks to Ed Beck of the SUNY Oneonta TLTC for getting this project moving and for all of his good advice—that I sometimes ignore to my detriment—since the pandemic began.
